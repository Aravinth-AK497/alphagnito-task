        <p class="page2-text mb-3">
          The weather can change from one minute to the next. At this very moment on Earth there are roughly two
          thousand thunderstorms raining down around the world.
        </p>

        <p class="page2-text mb-3">
          Thunderstorms form when warm, moist air rises and meets up with colder air in Earth's atmosphere. As the warm
          air cools, the moisture turns into small water droplets, called rain. The cool air starts to fall. Then, it
          warms up and rises again. This cycle of rising is called a storm cell. It causes thunderstorms to form. These
          storms are known for their heavy rain, wind, lightning, and thunder!
        </p>

        <p class="page2-text mb-3">
          Sometimes, if the conditions are right, these storms can make tornadoes. A tornado is a fast-spinning column
          of air. It forms out of a thunderstorm. If the warm rising air in a storm cell collides with fast-moving
          winds, then a tornado funnel cloud may form.
        </p>

        <p class="page2-text mb-3">
          People cannot stop tornadoes from forming. But they can learn to predict them. They can warn one another when
          they are coming. They can also prepare for them to stay safe.
